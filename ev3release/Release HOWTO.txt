For running the ant based release utilities successfully, you will need to have

- an ANT installation (at least 1.6). The one in Eclipse should be OK.
- all changed pulled from Git

To create a new release of leJOS EV3 in Eclipse on Linux, please perform the following steps:

1. Update the following files:
	ev3release/lejos_ev3/README.md
	and other documentation for the release
2. Update the following files with the current version number:
	EV3Menu/src/lejos/ev3/startup/Config.java
	ev3installer/leJOS_EV3_Installer.iss
	ev3release/build.properties
4. Ensure you have the latest lejosimage.zip. The release/build.xml does
   not build it. It is located at ev3snapshot/sdcard.
5. Test that all the samples and pcsamples run successfully.
6. Check the the API docs builds without errors or warnings.
7. Ensure that the ev3release/build.xml script is up to date
8. Build and test the Eclipse plugin - see EclipsePlugin.HOWTO
9. Update this file if there are any changes in the way the release is built
10. Right click on release/build.xml and select "Run As", "Ant Build"
11. After the ant script has finished, the packed distributions for Linux and Windows may be found
    inside the folder ev3release/dist.
12. Install Inno Setup (unicode version) and open/compile ev3installer/leJOS_EV3_Installer.iss
13. After that, the installer can be found at ev3installer/leJOS_EV3_<version>_win32_setup.exe

There are other steps that are needed after this to release the product:

A. Update the Wiki
B. Test the release Windows installer and other distribution on as many operating systems as possible. Ensure
   that the instructions in README.hml and in the tutorial work for this release.
C. Release the Windows installer and zip file versions, and the Linux/MAC OSX distribution using the sourceforge
   File Release System.
D. Open the file details of the Windows installer and the Linux/OSX tarball in the sourceforge file release system,
    and make the files as the default download for Windows and Linux/OSX respectively. 
E. Copy the EV3 api docs to htdocs/ev3/api on the sourceforge web site.
F. Copy the contents of the dist folder in the org.lejos.ev3.ldt.update-site project to htdocs/tools/eclipse/plugin/ev3.
   Rename the old version first by appending its version number.
G. Announce the release, tutorial and Eclipse plugin on the lejos web site with new items.
H. Announce the release on the forums.
I. Create tags with the release number in both of the GIT repositories.
J. Announce the release on the developers mailing list.
